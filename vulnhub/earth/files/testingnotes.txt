Testing secure messaging system notes:
*Using XOR encryption as the algorithm, should be safe as used in RSA.
*Earth has confirmed they have received our sent messages.
*testdata.txt was used to test encryption.
*terra used as username for admin portal.
Todo:
*How do we send our monthly keys to Earth securely? Or should we change keys weekly?
*Need to test different key lengths to protect against bruteforce. How long should the key be?
*Need to improve the interface of the messaging interface and the admin panel, it's currently very basic.
